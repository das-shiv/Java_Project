Static:

- The static keyword is used in java to make variables and methods as static.
- If any class variable is declared as static, it can be accessed using the class name without creating an object.
- All the objects of that class gets the same static variable value.


Static Method:

- If any method is made static then we can access the method using the class name without
  creating any object.

- We can not access non static variables from inside the static method directly.
- If we pass an object of the class as an argument while calling the static method, we can
  access the non static variables belonging to that object.
